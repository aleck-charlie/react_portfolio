# Charlie's Portfolio

Welcome to my second launched portfolio page! This single page app was created using React and CSS, with a brief bio landing page and links to my resume and LinkedIn. 

## Deployment

You can find this app deployed on GitPages https://aleck-charlie.github.io/react_portfolio/

## Future updates
Future versions of my portfolio will include images of myself, updated screenshots of deployed apps, a gallery page for digital illustation/moving image art, and a contact form to reach me at. 

All future portfolios will include a gallery of past versions to showcase how this project evolves.

Enjoy!
